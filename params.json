It will help steer you in the right direction when you're looking\r\nfor stuff in Emacs (like buffers, files, etc).\r\n\r\nHelm is a fork of `anything.el` originaly written by Tamas Patrovic\r\nand can be considered to be its successor. \r\n`Helm` sets out to clean up the legacy code in `anything.el`\r\nand provide a cleaner, leaner and more modular tool, that's not tied in\r\nthe trap of backward compatibility. \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nYou need a recent Emacs to use latest helm, at least Emacs-24.3.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Quick install\r\n\r\n  1. Clone the `helm` repository to some directory:\r\n  \r\n    ```elisp\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm.git /path/to/helm/directory\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n  2. Run `make` from this directory.\r\n  3. Add to `.emacs.el` (or equivalent):\r\n\r\n    ```elisp\r\n    (add-to-list 'load-path \"/path/to/helm/directory\")\r\n    (require 'helm-config)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can have a quick try to helm by launching from the helm directory:\r\n\r\n`./emacs-helm.sh`\r\n\r\nNote that this will not work on Windows systems.\r\n\r\n### Install from Emacs packaging system\r\n\r\nHelm is now available on Melpa at `http://melpa.milkbox.net/`\r\nYou will find there instructions to install.\r\n\r\n_WARNING:_ For any upgrade after Version 1.5.6 using package.el, you will have to remove all your helm*.elc files\r\nand recompile from a clean Emacs, expect failures if you don't do that.\r\nUsers that are installing from git will not have this problem\r\nby recompiling their helm copy with \"make\".\r\n\r\n**Note to Linux Distributions Maintainers**\r\n\r\n`Only the extensions present in the github emacs-helm organisation are supported.`\r\n\r\n### Alternate install warning\r\n\r\nSome people are installing `helm` with their own config using diverses `require`, `autoload`\r\nand other hacks, not using `helm-config`.\r\nExpect failures and slowdown at startup unless you really know what you are doing when you do so.\r\n\r\n### Emacs Prelude\r\n\r\nIf you're afraid to play with Emacs's configuration, but want to try\r\nout Helm - have NO FEAR. Have a look at\r\n[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) - it has\r\nHelm built-in and properly set-up.\r\n\r\n### Basic usage\r\n\r\nJust type `M-x helm-mini` and enjoy. You might want to bind that command to\r\na keyboard shortcut. Here's a suggestion:\r\n\r\n```elisp\r\n(global-set-key (kbd \"C-c h\") 'helm-mini)\r\n```\r\nYou can also start with `M-x helm-mode` and enjoy helm completion in your favourites\r\nEmacs commands (e.g `M-x`, `C-x C-f`, etc...).\r\nYou can enable this by adding in your init file:\r\n\r\n```elisp\r\n(helm-mode 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a startup point you can also look at the helm section in Emacs menu to\r\ndiscover some of the commands provided by helm.\r\n\r\n### Advanced usage\r\n\r\nHelm is capable of a lot. Here is a demo of `helm-buffers-list`:\r\n\r\n![helm-buffers-list](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/blob/master/doc/helm-buffers-list.gif)\r\n\r\nThe demo starts when you see `Eval: START` in the minibuffer.\r\n\r\n- All the C buffers are selected using the regexp `*C`. In the demo, I also select Tcl buffers with `*Tcl` and then switched back to C buffers with `*C`.\r\n- I only want to have buffers that contains only the string \"crash\". To do that, I add a space, then add the pattern `@crash`.\r\n- After the initial search pattern, I hand over the current matching buffers to `helm-moccur` - `moccur` with Helm interface. \r\n- Candidates can be filtered gradually by adding more pattern, i.e. I added `memory` to filtered down to buffers that contain the string \"memory\" among the buffers that are containing \"crash\".\r\n\r\nAs you can see, as you filtered out, the number of candidates decreases, as displayed in the modeline. At the end, there were 12 buffers remained as the result of filtering, down from the total 253 buffers.\r\n\r\nYou can read [this guide](http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html) to quickly get started with Helm.\r\n\r\nYou can find all the gory details on the [Helm Wiki](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki).\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\nCheck out the project's\r\n[issue list](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open)\r\na list of unresolved issues. By the way - feel free to fix any of them\r\nand sent us a pull request. :-)\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nHere's a [list](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/contributors) of all the people who have contributed to the\r\ndevelopment of Helm.\r\n\r\n## Bugs & Improvements\r\n\r\nBug reports and suggestions for improvements are always\r\nwelcome. GitHub pull requests are even better! :-)\r\n\r\nNOTE: When trying if something is working or not, be sure to start helm from `Emacs -Q` or even better\r\nStart it from your helm directory with `./emacs-helm.sh`.\r\n\r\n## Getting help\r\n\r\nIf [Helm Wiki](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki) is not enough, you can ask for help\r\non [emacs-helm google group](https://groups.google.com/group/emacs-helm?hl=en).\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,<br>\r\nThe Helm Team\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-54420623-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
